<h1> The Best Colors</h1>
<h2>According to Kylie</h2>
<p style="color: white;"> So these are the best colors according to me, so obviously that means that these are the best colors in the world.</p>

<p style="color:white"> This light <b style="color:lavender">lavender</b> color is really nice. I feel like it's just a really peaceful color, and if you hate this color... then there's probably something wrong with you.</p>

<p>Omg guys, I'm so sorry I had to scare you with this color. I forgot to mention that I will also be including the ugliest colors, and this is definitely close to being one of the most disgusting colors... <b style="color: rgb(25, 255, 71)">neon green</b>...</p>

<p> Okay guys, this color is also really nice. <b style="color: rgb(92, 8, 8)">Dark red</b> is just such a beautiful color... it's like wine and just so delicious looking. This is definitely close to #1 best color ever. </p>

<p> For some reason I couldn't get a picture of a neon orange, but when I say orange is disgusting, obviously all shades of orange are horrifying to look at, but especially <b style="color: rgb(255, 179, 0)">neon orange</b>.</p>

<p style="background-color: rgb(99, 92, 99);"> Alright guys, you're welcome for blessing your eyes and sorry for probably also damaging your eyesight, but hope you enjoyed!</p>
